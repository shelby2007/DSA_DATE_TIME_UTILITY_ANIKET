> A modern desktop application built with Java Swing for managing events and performing various date/time calculations.

The Date-Time Utility Library is a comprehensive desktop application that combines time calculation utilities (like age calculation and time format conversions) with a robust event scheduler. It features a modern, clean UI with sidebar navigation, theme support, and a background daemon for real-time event reminders.

## Features

- **Event Scheduler**
  - Add, edit, and delete events.
  - Search and filter events by title, description, location, or date.
  - Priority levels for events (Low, Medium, High).
- **Background Reminders**
  - Configurable push notifications (`JOptionPane`) via a background daemon thread.
  - Reminder offsets: At time of event, 15 min, 30 min, 1 hour, or 1 day before.
- **Time Utilities**
  - View current time in customizable formats.
  - Calculate time differences between two times.
  - Convert between 12-hour (AM/PM) and 24-hour formats.
  - Add or subtract minutes from a given time.
- **Age Calculator**
  - Calculate exact age based on Date of Birth (Years, Months, Days).
  - Detailed age statistics (total weeks, days, hours, minutes, seconds).
  - Countdown to the next birthday.
- **Data Persistence**
  - Saves all events locally to a flat-file (`events_data.txt`), requiring no database setup.
- **Modern User Interface**
  - Swing-based UI with CardLayout for smooth navigation.
  - Sidebar with hover states and active-tab highlights.
  - (Planned) Dark/Light mode theme switching.

*(Note: Date Utilities are currently planned/under construction).*

## Installation

Follow these steps to run the project from scratch on your local machine:

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ashmitraj0344/Date-Time-Utility-Library.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project folder**
   ```bash
   cd Date-Time-Utility-Library
   ```

3. **Install dependencies and Build project**
   Since this is a Maven project, compile the source files using:
   ```bash
   mvn clean install
   ```

4. **Run the project**
   You can compile and run the application directly using `javac` and `java`:
   ```bash
   javac -d target -sourcepath src/main/java src/main/java/app/Main.java
   java -cp target app.Main
   ```
   *Alternatively, open the project in your favorite IDE and run `app.Main.java`.*

## Requirements

- **Java Version**: JDK 17 or higher.
- **Maven**: Version 3.6.0 or higher.
- **Database**: None required.
- **OS**: Windows, macOS, or Linux (requires GUI environment).

---

## Usage

1. **Dashboard**: Upon launching, the dashboard gives you a quick overview of your events. Use the left sidebar to navigate.
2. **Adding an Event**: Click on the "Event Scheduler" tab or use the "Add Event" dialog to create a new task. Fill out the mandatory Date (`yyyy-MM-dd`) and Time (`HH:mm`) fields.
3. **Setting Reminders**: When adding an event, check "Set Reminder" and choose your offset. Keep the app open; a popup will appear when the time arrives.
4. **Time & Age Calculations**: Navigate to the respective tabs in the sidebar, input your date/time, and see instant calculated results.

## Configuration

This project requires minimal configuration. Data is saved locally in the root directory as `events_data.txt`. 
- No environment variables are necessary.
- The `pom.xml` handles the compiler configuration (Source/Target set to Java 17).

---

## Dependencies

The project relies entirely on **Core Java (Standard Library)**. 
- No external libraries (like Hibernate, Spring, or Apache Commons) are used, making it incredibly lightweight and easy to run anywhere.

---

## Architecture

The application follows a standard monolithic **MVC-like (Model-View-Controller)** pattern:
- **Model**: Represents the core data structures (e.g., `Event.java`).
- **Storage Layer**: `FileManager.java` intercepts model data and handles I/O operations (Serialization/Deserialization using a custom `|||` delimiter).
- **Scheduler/Service Layer**: `EventScheduler.java` acts as the controller, maintaining the state of all events in memory and running a daemon Thread (`startReminderCheckLoop()`) to trigger UI callbacks.
- **View (UI)**: Swing JFrame and JPanels that listen to the `EventScheduler` and update dynamically.

---

## Modules / Packages

- **`app`**: Contains the `Main` class which bootstraps the Swing UI and applies the cross-platform Look and Feel.
- **`model`**: Contains POJOs (Plain Old Java Objects) like `Event` representing the data.
- **`scheduler`**: Contains the core logic for filtering, searching, and managing the reminder thread.
- **`storage`**: Contains logic for reading/writing data to the filesystem safely.
- **`ui`**: Contains the main `Dashboard` frame, custom dialogs, and individual `panels` mapped to the sidebar navigation.
- **`utility`**: Contains static helper methods for pure calculations (`AgeCalculator`, `TimeUtility`).

---

## Future Improvements

- Fully implement the `DateUtility` functionality.
- Add recurring events (daily, weekly, monthly).
- Integrate an SQLite or H2 embedded database for better querying and indexing.
- Allow exporting events to `.ics` (iCalendar) format.
- Add drag-and-drop support in the Calendar View.
